# Fantasy Races
Creating a new character involves understanding the traits they share with you and the traits they don't.
<details>
  <summary>Human</summary>
 Age: Humans reach adulthood after about two decades and generally live less than a century.               
 Size: Adult humans vary wildly in height and build, but most stand between five feet and just over six feet tall and weigh between 100 and 250 pounds. 
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Dwarf</summary>  
  Age: Dwarves are recognised as adults by age twenty, but are still considered "young" until age fifty. They live to an average age of 350 years.           
  Size: Adult dwarves stand four to five feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Elf</summary>
  Age: Elves mature at about the same rate as humans but consider themselves childlike and inexperienced until about their 100th birthday.
  They typically live for more than 700 years.                        
  Size: Elves are generally a bit shorter than huumans. They are very slender and beautiful.

# Weapons
## Swords
 <details>
  <summary>Shortsword</summary>
  Nimble and adaptable, shortswords are popular across most character classes.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Longsword</summary>
  The versatile longsword offers a great balance between the speed of a shortsword and the hefty power of a greatsword. As a one-handed weapon, they permit a
  hero to deliver swift, sharp strikes while allowing for a  shield as extra protection. Used with both hands, longswords focus the full brunt of a warrior's
  strength into punishing blows.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Greatsword</summary>
  The greatsword is a mighty weapon requiring immense strength and skill to use effectively. Any untrained heroes may wind up hurting themselves more than their
  opponents if they wade into battle with one of these!
</details>

## Polearms
<details>
  <summary>Pike</summary>
  Simple and effective, an inexpensive pike is a great weapon choice for starting heroes who find themselves short on gold. The spike dilivers sharp stabbing damage
  to enemies, and can even be thrown if needed.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Glaive</summary>
  The curved hook of a glaive allows it to deal extra damage. You can even use it to snare opponents and pull them in up close! The sharp edge of the blade can be 
  used to stab or slash at foes for even more attack options.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Halberd</summary>
  Combining the reach of a pike with the blade of an axe, a halberd opens up even more fighting techniques for a trained warrior. By gripping the staff near the base,
  you gain a wider range for your slashes, while holding it closer to the blade will deliver blows with a mighty impact.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Fang Tian Ji</summary>
  The complex blade of a fang tian ji is best placed in the hands of a highly trained fighter, for it takes years of experience to master the many attacks this weapon 
  can achieve. Stabbing, slashing even blunt impact from the flat side of the blade, this weapon will give you countless ways to overcome your foes.
